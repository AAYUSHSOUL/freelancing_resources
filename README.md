## Data Freelancing Resources

### This repository contains links to resources for anyone interested in data freelancing

Background: Over the last several years I have collected these resources to share with individuals who have reached out for advice on freelancing in data work. I do not endorse any particular resource in this list. My hope is that these resources might help others navigate this space better than I did when I first started my freelancing career. :)
